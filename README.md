# TaskBarDayIcon

When using Window with the task bar set to use small icons, only the time is displayed.
I never know what the day is, so I created this app to display the Day of the Month on a taskbar icon.

The app will start minimized and update the icon programmatically every 15 minutes.
If you leave your system on over night it will update to display the current day.
